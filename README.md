# HomeHub
A home management App with different modules to help manage a personal home.

## 🚀 Objective

The goal of **HomeHub.API** is to provide a centralized app for common household needs.  
It starts as a simple inventory tracker but is designed to grow into a **multi-module platform** for managing various aspects of home life, such as:

- Kitchen stock & grocery planning  
- Household chores & reminders  
- Basic automation & notifications  

The long-term vision is to make HomeHub a **personal “smart home hub”** that you can self-host, integrate with other services, or extend with custom modules.
